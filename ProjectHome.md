Project Description:
Every day people post “tweets”, which are 140-letter sentences, to a social network service, twitter.com. Each tweet may convey a fact or a personal opinion to the fact. Although a single sentence represents just a simple thought, a collection of sentences can make a trend of public opinions. If we can identify common topics and their feelings based their tweets, this can be a good source of understanding what people think.

We can manually read tweets to figure out the trend of “what people say” and “how they feel” but this is time-consuming and tedious. In “twiiter.com”, a million of tweets are posted every day. We need to identify topics of these tweets (what they say) and figure out their sentiment (how they feel). In addition, spam messages should be filtered out. Human resources are too expensive for this task.

Fortunately, recent technologies such as topic modeling and opinion mining can make this task automatic. For example, the following image shows a result of applying these techniques to a specific topic (TV show called “Game of Throne”). This result is telling us that 58,000+ comments are collected and genders and sentiments of these comments are automatically figured out. In addition, the temporal trend of the comments shows which time people say their thinking more frequently.

This project aims to automatically extract topics and opinions of tweets in twitter.com. The following techniques can be utilized to achieve the goal of this project:

1. Twitter.com Open API to retrieve tweets.
2. Database for tweet collection.
3. Spam filtering
4. Topic modeling
5. Sentiment (opinion) Analysis

The result of this project can be a prototype tool. We can apply this tool to many practical applications including:

1. Identification of major topics within a specific time window.
2. Reputation mining for a specific topic.
3. Temporal trend of public opinions.
4. Personal interest mining.
5. Opinion leader mining.
